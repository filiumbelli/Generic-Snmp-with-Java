# Generic-Snmp-with-Java
Java Snmp Management System

Basic snmp manager system that can be used by files. I would recommend to use absolute path for files.
Check the order of the values before inserting anythin to the files.
If you have a clue or misunderstanding, feel free to create an issue.
It will be modified with hibernate and jpa support.

Open for gui designers support
